# RedFaction.BombDefuse.PracticeTool
A simple WinForms application that functions similarly to "the bomb" in Red Faction, so you can practice without needing to keep going back into the game

Install
------
This doesn't install onto your machine, but runs in the folder instead.
To do this, simply grab the latest build from the releases page, extract the zip, and double-click the RedFaction.BombDefuse.PracticeTool.exe file

Usage
------
It works exactly the same way as the bomb in Red Faction, just without a timer, or awful beep noises.
Press an arrow key and see if it populates the box. If it does, you got that one right.
If you get one wrong, all of the arrows on the current row (representing the top and bottom panels of the bomb in Red Faction) get cleared out.

When you've got all 4 correct on the top row, those are "locked in", and subsequent arrow key presses only impact the bottom row.
When you have all 7 correct on the bottom row you get a "Bomb Defused" message, and you must press the "Reset" button to start again (no further inputs are accepted until the bomb is reset)
